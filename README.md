Multiplayer Stratego

This is a node server and javascript client for the board game Stratego.

TODO:

Looking into draw conditions that end the game

Need to validate the board placement so that its not 6 bombs in front

combine player1pieces and player2pieces objects?

generalize all the duplicated p1/p2 code in stratego.js

if the final piece is a replace, highlight the one left over

auto generate names instead of player 1 and player 2
